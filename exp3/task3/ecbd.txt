This is the last time that this ends
I stride in the cold
After the fireworks get old
You said I was vain, must have been bitter
Chippin' the paint off of my fingers
Really don't have a lot to say tonight
But I
Wanna be kind
With this attitude
No one hates you like I do
So rest assured
I'm never coming back to you
No one hates you like I do
Like I do, like I do
